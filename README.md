# TME_fibroblast
## Background
Understanding the role of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human liver cancer is crucial for developing therapeutic methods specifically targeting tumor-promoting CAFs. Here, we describe a CAF subpopulation associated with cancer stemness and immunosuppressive TME by directly interacting with liver cancer stem cells or inhibitory M2 macrophages.

## Usage
This code was developed in R version (4.1.3) for statistical analyses of spatial transcriptomics data and proteomics data. The detail infomation can refer to Supplementary Methods.

Quantitative data for the **proteome** can be obtained from /proteome/DATA_all_sample.xls

Raw **spatial transcriptomics** data can be obtained from the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.
